https://blog.devgenius.io/vscode-tips-tricks-98c6e2258626 

I personally found this article interesting to read, because I also rely heavily on VS Code when it comes to coding or creating projects, like many other developers. I believe that there's no end to learning, especially with code development, and there are always more ways you can improve, whether it has to do with optimizing your code or improving your organization. This article not only provides interesting statistics about VS Code and developers, but serves as a useful tool to improving productivity and efficacy with VS Code features and shortcuts. By uploading this particular article for this assignment, I am hoping it will be of help to others as well.
